              "1442  this hotel is ok depending on its price. i had to pay almost â‚¬150 per night which is not worth the stay. rooms are decent and clean but very cramped. also the chairs in the breakfast room feel like they were made for midgets. the elevator can only fit 1 person with a bag. on the good side: whole hotel is very clean and personnel is really friendly                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe\\nName: hotel_name, dtype: object\n",
              "1443  this is the worst hotel i have ever stayed. since you enter the reception they cannot be bothered to recommend you any restaurant or even to show you on the map. this suppose to be 4* but should be 2*. an awful bathroom dirty floor horrible service. just worst hotel i ever visited. do not waste your money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe\\nName: hotel_name, dtype: object\n",

              "1447  rated as 4 stars but is worst than what i expected. no water provided mini bar was empty. during this hot summer air conditioning wasnâ€™t working properly sweat the whole night.the room next to the lift was not a good room. you can hear the noise of the lift and people talking load.the only advantage is there is a sauna and mini pool at 0 floor.i would not recommend this hotel if you want a good night sleep.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe\\nName: hotel_name, dtype: object\n",
              "1448  we stayed at this hotel for 6 nights while on our recent trip to paris. our room was located on the 1st floor so we did not need to take the elevator which was fine with us as we love to climb stairs. the room was comfortable with a king sized bed and mini bar fridge. lots of closet space as well as goodsized bathroom with shower and tub. the staff were always courteous and knowledgable and went out of their way to answer any question we had about the city of paris as well as about the hotel itself. the hotel does offer a reasonable breakfast option but we chose not to go that route as there are many places to eat in the vicinity of the hotel. it is paris afterall and there are cafes on every street corner : the only thing that caught us off guard when looking over the final bill was the city tax or tourism tax which is an additional 10% on top of the hotel price this was not made clear when initially booking the hotel...but i suppose that is to be expected when travelling to a city such as paris.....overall a very good hotel so highly recommend staying here when coming to paris.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe\\nName: hotel_name, dtype: object\n",
              "1449  this short break was a surprise i had no idea what was going on or what to expect. me and partner had planning a paris get away but i had no idea he had booked everything and we were doing with a few days. the hotel is small but just what we needed. the staff were polite and very helpful. we had a late eurostar back to st pancras and the staff were kind enough to look after our luggage whilst we were to explore more or paris.the hotel is used more by business people so it pretty quiet and not many people around which was a bonus for us as we had the swimming pool and sauna to ourselves. we didnâ€™t have breakfast but i read there was a nice patisserie down the road but i could not find this but when in a city like paris food isnâ€™t a problem youâ€™re only a short distance from somewhere to eat.the hotel is 10 minute walk from arc de triomphe. which was lovely... and a short distance for everything else. my partner absolutely loved the little iphone pod speakers you just plug your iphone in an have music whatever you want to listen to on.lovely hotel and lovely city definitely will be staying here again                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe\\nName: hotel_name, dtype: object\n",
              "1450  stayed for 3 nights location was perfect for sightseeing. we had a room on the 6th floor which was extremely quiet. the room and bathroom was pretty small but that is to be expected in such a central location. linen toileteries etc were good quality. breakfast was perfect the cook was very attentive and took pride in setting out the food etc. this stood out after our two previous hotels in barcelona and porto. staff were friendly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe\\nName: hotel_name, dtype: object\n",

              "1452  my husband was running in the paris marathon i decided on this hotel as it has a small pool and thought that he might benefit from it after his long run which he did. on arrival at the hotel our room wasnt quite ready as wed left the uk very early the receptionist was very apologetic we were offered refreshments and use of facilities and perfectly happy to wait. the room was perfect the chamber person whose name we didnt get showed us the room and he gave info on how to use the heating etc. he got my husband and extra duvet as requested. the staff at reception were lovely giving us advice on directions as needed. maddy the night clerk was extremely helpful and went out of his way to find restaurants and bars within walking distance for us. he was very cheery and friendly. we were leaving on the last eurostar of the day our luggage was kept safe so we were free to sight see for the rest of the day. i love paris and wouldnt hesitate to book this hotel again. a big thank you to everyone for making us feel so welcome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe\\nName: hotel_name, dtype: object\n",
              "1453  i liked the hotel their staff especially the lady at the reception is really nice and helpful. the hotel was pretty clean but our room was super super small located in the left hand side of the elevator at 7th floor. everything is in walking distance. overall i do recommend this hotel and would be back for sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe\\nName: hotel_name, dtype: object\n",
              "1454  i spent one night at the westside arc de triomphe before attending an education fair close by the following day.i booked this hotel because it was in short walking distance to the exhibition hall but i was a little concerned by some of the negative comments i saw on here. my experience though was nothing but positive. i received such a warm welcome on arrival. my french is terrible but i will always try to speak it. however the friendly receptionist switched to english with no problem and was friendly throughout the checkin process. i was then shown to my room by a young man originally from bangladesh. during the short ride in the lift to the 7th floor we managed to discuss various locations in the south of england as well as our favourite dishes at bengali restaurants in the uk. it is a small hotel in a small parisian street and so of course the rooms will not be too big but mine was clean comfortable and had all the amenities i needed. at breakfast the next morning i was greeted like an old friend and i found the food plentiful and delicious. checkout was again easy and with a friendly smile. i would not hesitate to stay here again and would recommend it to anybody wanting a more cosy environment than the bigger hotels offer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe\\nName: hotel_name, dtype: object\n",

              "1461  we stayed here for 3 nights at the end of april for a long weekend seeing the sights of paris with my parents. this hotel is in a good location close to restaurants and the metro station. the rooms were small as people have said but we hardly spent any time in them as we were out and about every day bed was comfortable and room kept nice and clean. i really enjoyed the macaroons on arrival : the reception staff were really friendly and always on hand if you needed any advice on how to get to places. we only ate breakfast in the hotel once as this was not included in the price it was a good breakfast with enough choice. we got breakfast one day from the local patisserie down the road the pastries were delicious all in all a good hotel at a reasonable price that i would recommend to friends and family.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe\\nName: hotel_name, dtype: object\n",
              "1462  prosthe location of the hotel was the only bright spot in our stay. the lady manning the reception during the mornings was very professional and very friendly. also the second lady we met during our stay whose name eludes me was quite friendly too. conswe checked in to westside on the 6th evening. the lady who checked us in was professional and courteous. the lady in the morning every day was also very professional and courteous. but there was a gentleman we dealt with in the evening every time who was eternally grumpy and seemed to react like we were an interruption to what he was doing. the hotel rooms were very small for a 4 star hotel and not what we expected. the breakfast was one table with bread and croissants and few other knick knacks. you would definitely expect more from a 4 star hotel. on our second day we ordered room service and i ordered lentil soup lebanese platter and french fries. we waited for more than 90 minutes and after multiple follow ups i got lentil soup a plate of cheese and no french fries. i did not have dinner that night. apparently this hotel does not have \" room service\" in house. they just order from a nearby restaurant and so there is a lot lost in translation. my sisters family who were staying with us could not get water delivered either. overall it was a very disappointing stay especially after travelling through italy switzerland and getting some amazing service from similar sized and similar category hotels. as mentioned the plus points were the location and the friendly lady receptionists who were professional and courteous. the remaining staff were quite unfriendly and we felt quite unwelcome including the ladies at the breakfast who were very curt. i provide this feedback as a constructive feedback so the hotel can view the service from the perspective of the recipient of such services and look at ways to enhance the same.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe\\nName: hotel_name, dtype: object\n",
              "1463  i had to pay the breakfast charge that was about 40euro before checking out. however the lady from the reception desk wanted to charge me 300euro and she gave me an attitude that she thought i didnt speak english before i was even going to ask her any question. i was confused and told her that i had paid everything through hotel.com and i asked her what 300euro was coming from. she told me it was \"government tax\" and did not bother explaining anything further. she went on and had my credit card wiped and made me sign the bill. this is my first time to france and i had a flight to catch so i did not want to start a fight with her that might ruin my day and i did really act like a gentleman. fortunately at the end she somehow realized she made a mistake by herself and returned my money. however this is a very unpleasant experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe\\nName: hotel_name, dtype: object\n",
              "1464  visited from 23/01/2017 to 26/01/2017. had an enjoyable stay. didnt spend much time in the hotel itself as there is so much to explore in paris. the room was made up everyday with fresh towels etc. fulfilled all requirements and expectations but nothing was out of the ordinary which can be expected on a budget. the pool and sauna facilities are nice after a long day on your feet. the location is ideal for tourists. would recommend to travellers on a budget.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe\\nName: hotel_name, dtype: object\n",

              "1469  we stayed here last week 30thaugust  1st september for 2 nights and found it to be a very nice hotel. as people have already mentioned the lift was very small it says it takes 4 people we had a job with 2 of us and hubby had to bring the case up separately. the room was clean but could have done with decorating the corner of the ceiling had had a leak from above i would think because it was brown and flaking. the view was terrible right outside our window was an iron spiral fire escape and we looked onto the rooms opposite but the room was clean and the bed very comfortable. the bathroom was good with everything you would need including a hairdryer and the bath had a shower over itwhich my husband had to struggle to help me into to have my shower. breakfast was continental or if you preferred there was scrambled eggs bacon and sausage. the young lady on breakfast duty was very polite and made sure there was hot food all the time. the front of house staff were very friendly and welcoming. there are plenty of eateries within walking distance and the arc de triomphe and the champselysee were within walking distance if you feel so inclined but because i am disabled i am not able to walk very far so we took a bus ride and people were so kind as soon as they saw my sticks they were offering me their seats. we got to the arc de triomphe only to find that the lift was not working they said 4pm so we went and had lunch in a little pub just across from the arc called the beer station which is on bis avenue and opposite the lateral and had the best french onion soup i have ever tasted. we went back to the arc and the lift was still not working so i told hubby one of us had to go to the top so he had to go. omg i didnt realise there were so many steps poor man there were over 300 of them but he did it and brought me a lovely present from the top. buses to and from the arc are very frequent every 5 minutes. one thing i want to warn people about is the parking there is none at the hotel and if you arrive at night its not the easiest place to find so look out for two small potted conifer trees these are each side of the doorway. the parking is in the multistory car park about 510 minutes walk from the car park back to the hotel but there are plenty of eateries on the walk back. the price was approx 32.50 euros a night which seems quite steep to me. all in all a very nice hotel.  29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe\\nName: hotel_name, dtype: object\n",

              "1471  stayed here with my girlfriend for 3 nights last week. hotel is very central about 10 minute walk to arc. surrounded by lovely cafe bars and restaurants. it took 10 minutes to walk from the bus station for the the beauvais airport shuttle. the metro 10 mins from the hotel is a direct route to disneyland. staff were very friendly. the pool and sauna is great for relaxing after walking and exploring the city it stays open until 10pm. honestly the bed was unreal very comfortable. i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting. great value for money                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe\\nName: hotel_name, dtype: object\n",
              "1472  this was my second visit to paris and upon arrival at our hotel i was pleased to find it was sort of out of the tourist centre. this seems odd because it is very centrally located to the arc de triomphe an easy though up hill walk and this is right on the tourist heart but in the streets surrounding the hotel you really only see locals lots of business people who reside there. especially of an evening there are suits in all the surrounding restaurants and cafes. this gave a much welcome respite from the crazy tourist areas. we really enjoyed arriving back here each evening and having the flexibility to head for the tourist buses if we wanted. the only downside to this is that due to the proximity of all the professionals each morning early you could hear plumbing and elevators start going while being on holiday we tried to sleep in. my partner slept through but id be awake from about 6am7am before the rush subsided and i fell back asleep for a bit longer. but this is to be expected from old buildings i guess.the hotel itself is very quaint and of a nice size. the staff were always very pleasant and very helpful and were fluent in english which helped us a lot as our french is pretty poor.we had a private balcony looking over the street and we loved this it seems private balconys might be rare in this hotel so if we were to go back wed probably pay the extra to ensure we had one i may be wrong here this is just what it seemed.we liked this hotel especially its location and wed stay here again                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe\\nName: hotel_name, dtype: object\n",
              "1473  we stayed at the westside for three nights . a warm welcome in the pouring rain .umbrellas are provided by the hotel. about a 10 minute walk to the arc du triomphe. lots of eating places near buy. a quiet area at night away from the hustle and bustle of the champs elysees. the room was adequate with a balcony but one thing that cant be faulted was the hot water. the best hotel i have stayed in for getting hot water in europe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe\\nName: hotel_name, dtype: object\n",
              "1474  we stayed here for a weekend. we arrived at night. the nights we were there a guy called maddy was working at the reception. he is really friendly not only the checkin was quick and easy he also provided helpfull tips what we can see and do and eat in paris and the neighbourhood of the hotel.the room was ok. clean. not that big. the bathroom was a bit small. also the tv is on the left of the bed so it is not that comfortable to watch tv.the breakfast was included. the quality was pretty good. the options you had was a little limited but we enjoyed it.the location is pretty good. you can walk to a metro in 5 minutes. arc de triophe and avenue des champselysees is at about 10 minutes walking distance.the price was ok too.overall i would say that the hotel is at least above average. average would be a bit too low so that is why i rated it very good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe\\nName: hotel_name, dtype: object\n",
              "1475  we stopped at the westside for three nights over easter. we were met with a warm welcome which lasted throughout our stay. the room was not the largest but was more than adequate. we would recommend the breakfast as there was a great choice to suit all. we used google earth to plan a route from the hotel up to the arc de triomph this took about 20 minutes to walk at the most and was worth the preparation. we did have some rain showers and the hotel provides courtesy umbrellas so thankyou for a lovely visit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe\\nName: hotel_name, dtype: object\n",
              "1476  if you are unfamiliar with the economics of travel to paris i can sum it up in one word: expensive.we were very fortunate to find hotel westside as our home base for two nights in paris as part of a longer vacation that continued to barcelona.communication with the hotel in advance of our stay was easy and prompt.logisitics to finding the hotel were simple especially coming from cdg in the early am. simple take the rer b from cdg to chatelet les halles metro station and transfer to the m1 getting off at etoile charles de gaulles metro stationwhich is also the arc de triomphe. from there it was maybe an easy 15 minute stroll ... and you get to see the arc de triomphe every time you need to get on the metro.we arrived many hours ahead of checkin and staff were friendly and welcoming and very accomodating to my limited french. in fact their english was great. they stored our bags for us and we took off for a day of sightseeing.rooms are compact but conveniently appointed as you will find with most boutique hotels in europe.staff provided many suggestions for activities dining etc.around the corner from the hotel there is an excellent boulangerie that is incredibly inexpensive with amazing pain au chocolat pain au lait macarons etc.lots of diining options near the hotel.would definitley stay again and would definitely recommend this hotel to others looking for a comfortable base near the champs elysee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe\\nName: hotel_name, dtype: object\n",
              "1477  we stayed here for one night sunday 6th march as wed been at disneyland prior. we did have a bit of difficulty finding it becaue of my own stupidity there are 3 hotels with similar names so make sure you know its westside anyway once we got there there was another couple there but the man behind reception and the consierge greeted us straight away. the man behind the desk we later found out his name is tibo was extremely pleasant and very informative made sure we knew all details of the room breakfast and spa facilities. we also got upgraded no idea why to the top floor with a tower view and lovely balcony i think they upgraded us by around Â£200 as we only payed for a Â£64 room. everything was lovely in the room you get slippers dressing gowns posh toiletries and tea/bar stuff in your room. overall everything was amazing staff/ hotel/ view wish we could stop longer but i know that when we do come back to paris we will definately be stopping in hotel westside arc de triumph                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe\\nName: hotel_name, dtype: object\n",
              "1478  when i entered the room i was kind of surprised by the small room. in the bathroom there is really little space. if you are a tall person you cannot sit on the toilet because your knees will hit the wall.clean and well maintained but i prefer something more spacious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe\\nName: hotel_name, dtype: object\n",

              "1483  the rooms in this hotel need a bit of love and attention. they are quite basic and i didnt find the bed too comfy. also there are no irons in the room and these have to be brought separately from reception. the best part about the hotel was the staff on the reception desk  they were very friendly and gave us a great recommendation of a french restaurant for dinner.theres no bar as such in the hotel but there is a drinks menu and the receptionist will happily take an order and disappear to find the drinks and reappear with drinks and some peanuts.location great  15 mins walk max to the arc de triomphe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       29    Hotel Westside Arc de Triomphe\\nName: hotel_name, dtype: object\n",
